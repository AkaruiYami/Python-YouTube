# Yaho!

Yaho there~ I'm AkaruiYami, you may call me Aka or Yami and as you can see, I like programming. I know C++ and Java but I mostly familiar with Python.

Nice to meet you!

# My Content

Mostly my content is in Bahasa Melayu. Not because I don't want to speak in English, but I don't have the confidence to do it. Not yet. Hope one day I can confidently present my Python solution in English so more people can understand.

In my [YouTube][1] channel, I mostly shares solution and tips in Python. I sometimes shares things related to programming like what IDE I personally use.

# What You Should Expect In This Repo

Here is collections of all code that is from my YouTube video. I will also try my best to provide explanation to the code in form of markdown so do check the README.md in the folder.
