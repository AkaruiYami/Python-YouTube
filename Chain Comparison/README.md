Let say you want to check if the user's age is within certain range. Normally we can write code like this:

```python
if age >= 18 and age < 30:
    # Do something
```

but, we can shorten this code by chaining the comparison like below:

```python
if 18 <= age < 30:
    # Do something
```

This help you write code faster since you don't neet to whrite the variable twice.
